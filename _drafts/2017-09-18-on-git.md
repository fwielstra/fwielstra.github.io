TODO: Smarmy introduction.

 * Summary that it's about why git commit messages and PR messages matter
 * (maybe too attacking) A lot of people are casual about Git usage, take shortcuts. Easy to ignore.
 * This post blah blah blah, commits to pull requests, showing some tools you can use


## tools for PRs
 * github and gitlab's PR templates
 * Automatic sanity / hygiene checkers
    * note: pre-push hooks

## rebase all the things

## set a standard and check it during review

## use a commit template

## common complaints and counterpoints

 * Baw nobody reads this anyway
 * Duh it's in the story
 * Duh you can read the code right
 * I just want to write code
 * Baw this'll all just get squashed anyway
 * Buh this will no longer be relevant in X time period
 * I'm scared of rebasing
 * I dunno what to write
    * then tbf you shouldn't have written the code either
    * Einstein or Feynman (disputed) or nobody in specific said that if you can't explain it to a six year old / your grandmother, you don't understand it yourself. Same with Git. You don't understand the code you wrote yourself if you can't write a good commit message about it.
 * You're not the boss of me
