Y halo thar; this is my personal website, blog, and portfolio page where I try to put stuff in writing.

I am a software developer with a reasonably broad area of interests, but mostly experienced in front-end web development (web and native iOS development). I've also spent a nontrivial amount writing Java (usually web back-ends, REST APIs, some JSP), and have an interest in moving towards Go.

I currently work for [Xebia](http://xebia.com), a Dutch IT consultancy firm that dabbles in agile consultancy, architecture, and - of course - software development, the latter of which is quickly becoming their primary business.

I've made numerous attempts at blogging earlier; I've recently found an archive on [Tweakers.net](https://fgj.tweakblogs.net/blog/), I've had my own domain on greatjustice.info (or something like that), and I've made a number of posts on [the Xebia blog](http://blog.xebia.com/author/fwielstra/). I've tried to port some of those to here, but to be honest I'm too embarassed of my own writing after writing things to review it too much.

If you are a recruiter trying to reach out to me, please do some effort and first be able to understand what I do. When contacting me, please include:

 * What company you work for and want me to work for
 * What the job is (responsibilities, technologies, area of expertise)
 * Working conditions (if it's an open-plan office you can piss off)
 * The offered pay scale (rough indication is fine)

I will not reply to the generic "let's sit down for a chat!" thing if you're not being specific enough / just fishing. I don't see how that works for anyone. It clearly indicates you're a bot, haven't bothered to do basic research in your target, and probably don't even know what industry I'm in.
