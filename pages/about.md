Y halo thar; this is my personal website, blog, and portfolio page where I try to put stuff in writing. I sometimes get
the urge to write things.

I am a software developer with a reasonably broad area of interests, but mostly experienced in front-end web development
(web and native iOS development). I've also spent a nontrivial amount writing Java (usually web back-ends, REST APIs,
some JSP), and was recently able to move on to Go.

I currently work for a small company called [BroadForward](https://www.broadforward.com/), a product company in the
telecom industry whose product is (in a nutshell) a configurable multipurpose network application that can fulfill many
roles in a mobile network's systems, as well as link together multiple generations of mobile networks (3/4/5g).

I previously worked for a long time at [Xebia](http://xebia.com), a Dutch IT consultancy firm that dabbles in agile consultancy, architecture, and - of course - software development, the latter of which is quickly becoming their primary business.

I've made numerous attempts at blogging earlier; I've recently found an archive on
[Tweakers.net](https://fgj.tweakblogs.net/blog/), I've had my own domain on a domain greatjustice.info (or something
like that), and I've made a number of posts on [the Xebia blog](http://blog.xebia.com/author/fwielstra/). I've tried to
port some of those to here, but to be honest I'm too embarassed of my own writing after writing things to review it too
much.

If you are a recruiter trying to reach out to me, please do some effort and first be able to understand what I do. When contacting me, please include:

* What company you work for and want me to work for
* What the job is (responsibilities, technologies, area of expertise)
* Working conditions / environment (bustling open offices are a no)
* The offered pay scale (rough indication is fine)

I will not reply to the generic "let's sit down for a chat!" thing if you're not being specific enough / just fishing. I
don't see how that works for anyone. It clearly indicates you're a bot, haven't bothered to do basic research in your
target, and probably don't even know what industries I'm in. I'm aware that you don't want to divulge your employer
directly because you'll miss out on your commission if I bypass you, but that's a you problem.
