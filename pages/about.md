Y halo thar; this is my personal website, blog, and portfolio page where I try to put stuff in writing.

I am a software developer with a reasonably broad area of interests, but mostly experienced in front-end web development (web and native iOS development).

I currently work for [Xebia](http://xebia.com), a Dutch IT consultancy firm that dabbles in agile consultancy, architecture, and - of course - software development, the latter of which is quickly becoming their primary business.

If you are a recruiter, I am currently *not* for hire. However, if you are going to make me a job offer, please include:

 * What company you work for and want me to work for
 * What the job is (responsibilities, technologies, area of expertise)
 * Working conditions (if it's an open-plan office you can piss off)
 * The offered pay scale (rough indication is fine; I won't bother if it's equal or less than what I earn now)

I will not reply to the generic "let's sit down for a chat!" thing if you're not being specific enough / just fishing. I don't see how that works for anyone.
